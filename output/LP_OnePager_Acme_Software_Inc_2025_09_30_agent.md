## Key Risks & Mitigants
- Risk 1: Heavy reliance on a few key customers may pose a risk if any of them experience financial difficulties or decide to switch suppliers. Mitigant: Diversifying the customer base by actively seeking new clients and expanding into different markets can help reduce dependency on a few customers.
- Risk 2: Rapid revenue growth may strain operational capacity and lead to inefficiencies if not managed effectively. Mitigant: Implementing scalable processes, investing in technology to automate tasks, and hiring additional staff as needed can help support the growth without compromising operational efficiency.
- Risk 3: Fluctuations in raw material prices or supply chain disruptions could impact the high gross margins reported. Mitigant: Establishing long-term contracts with suppliers, maintaining buffer stock for critical materials, and actively monitoring market trends can help mitigate the impact of price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.
